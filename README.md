A Detailed and Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra in iPython Format for Visualization and Interactivity

The goal of this book is teach Linear Algebra in a detailed and accessible way. The book aims to start from the ground up, having only basic "College Algebra" as a prerequisite and building upon it with no logical hoops. The book is not intended to be proof rigorous, but it in a way is still proof oriented and following it should make things intuitive that you become convinced of the reason why the are the way they are.
