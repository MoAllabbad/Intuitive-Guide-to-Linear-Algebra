<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Solving Systems of Equations</h2>
<p>Continuing our fruits example, we already know that we should get <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> mangoes and <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> avocados. But, let us go through the exercise of systematically finding the answer.</p>
<div id="substitution" class="section level3" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Substitution</h3>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:Substitution1" class="example"><strong>Example 1.1  </strong></span><span class="math display">\[x + y = 20\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[    x = y \]</span>
</div>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>, we can substitute either <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as their values are one and the same. We can then write the first equation as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x + x = 20\]</span></p>
<p>or <span class="math display">\[y + y = 20\]</span></p>
<p>We can start by solving for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, where the left hand side (LHS) <span class="math inline">\(x + x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(x + x = 20\)</span> becomes: <span class="math display">\[2x = 20\]</span></p>
<p>This is an equation, which means we can perform the same operation on both sides of the equation and the equality would still hold. So, we can divide both sides by 2 where the LHS becomes <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the RHS becomes <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. So, the equation becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x = 10\]</span></p>
<p>That solved for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. To solve for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we can similarly solve the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y + y = 20\]</span></p>
<p>or we could go back to one of the original equations</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x + y = 20\]</span></p>
<p>and substitute back the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> since we solved for it, to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[10 + y = 20\]</span></p>
<p>Again, this is an equation so, we are able to perform the same operation on both sides. To solve for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we will subtract <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> from both sides:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[10 + y - 10 = 20 - 10\]</span></p>
<p>Which gives the answer:
<span class="math display">\[ y = 10\]</span></p>
<p>No surprise here, we got the answers we expected.</p>
<p>Now, let us say the mangoes and avocados are not exactly 1 bill each. For example, a mango is <span class="math inline">\(1.34\)</span> and an avocado is <span class="math inline">\(0.89\)</span>. What is the maximum you can buy with the number of mangoes and avocados being equal? The answer now is not as intuitive as before so, this is a situation where the systematic method is valuable.</p>
<p>Let us go back and try to apply the same steps. Our previous equation becomes:
<span class="math display">\[(x \times mangoes \times 1.34) \, bill + (y \times avocados \times 0.89) \, bill = 20 \times bills\]</span>
which simplifies to <span class="math display">\[1.34x + 0.89y = 20\]</span></p>
<p>So, now we have the following system:</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:Substitution2" class="example"><strong>Example 1.2  </strong></span><span class="math display">\[1.34x + 0.89y = 20\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[x = y\]</span>
</div>
<p>Let us start by substituting <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> this time since substituting the other way previously was arbitrary. We get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1.34y + 0.89y = 20\]</span></p>
<p>Adding the LHS, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2.23y = 20\]</span></p>
<p>Dividing both sides by <span class="math inline">\(2.23\)</span>, we get:
<span class="math display">\[y = 8.97\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>, then also <span class="math display">\[x = 8.97\]</span></p>
<p>We previously substituted back in the first equation (here, that would be <span class="math inline">\(1.34y + 0.89y = 20\)</span>) which was arbitrary and, as you can see it was easier to do that with the second equation here; <span class="math inline">\(x=y%\)</span>. When it gets a bit more complicated, doing enough of these by hand should help develop an intuition of which route is best.</p>
<p>Now, the answer says to get <span class="math inline">\(8.97\)</span> mangoes and <span class="math inline">\(8.97\)</span> avocados, which is probably not possible. It is relatively easy to see here why you do not take the answer at face value since we are representing everyday objects. This is an instance where it is important to understand the tools we are using and the problem we are trying to solve and therefore, how applicable the tools are.</p>
<p>So, assuming that you cannot buy but whole fruits, then you can buy <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> of each, saving <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 0.97\)</span>. Or, you could break the other restriction of <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> and buy one more of either mangoes or avocados.</p>
<p>Let us take one more example this time just abstractly. Let us solve the following system of equation by substitution:</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:Substitution3" class="example"><strong>Example 1.3  </strong></span><span class="math display">\[ x + 2y = 14\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ 3x - y = 7\]</span>
</div>
<p>To solve by substitution, we first need to isolate one variable. For example, we can isolate <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the first equation as an easy choice as it has 1 coefficient. It does not matter here which equation and which variable we chose in terms of the answer. Some choices might just take more or fewer steps than others, but we should get the same answer. Isolating <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the first equation, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x = 14 - 2y\]</span></p>
<p>Now, we substitute that for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the other equation to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 3(14 - 2y) - y = 7\]</span></p>
<p>We now have only one unknown, which we can solve for. This simplifies to <span class="math inline">\(42 - 6y -y = 7\)</span>, which gives us:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = 5\]</span></p>
<p>Now we plug this value back in any of the two original equations as we did before. We can pick any of the two equations because we used both to solve for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and, <span class="math inline">\(y=5\)</span> is now tied to both. You might want to try the rest of this example yourself as a quick check that you are following, and see if you get <span class="math inline">\(x = 4\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="elimination" class="section level3" number="1.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Elimination</h3>
<p>Another method for solving systems of equations is called solving by elimination. It also relies on the fact that we can do the same operation to both sides of an equation without effecting the equality. Let us look at the following system of equations:</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:Elimination1" class="example"><strong>Example 1.4  </strong></span><span class="math display">\[ 2x + 3y = 18 \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ 2x + 2y = 14 \]</span>
</div>
<p>If we pick any equation, we know two things; that by definition both sides are equal, and that we can perform the same operation to both sides and the equality still holds. So, if we pick the first equation and subtract the second equation from it as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (2x + 3y) - (2x + 2y) = (18) - (14) \]</span></p>
<p>On the LHS, the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> cancels out, which is why it called <strong>Elimination</strong>, and we are left with <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. On the RHS, we get <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. So now we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y = 4 \]</span></p>
<p>Is this the correct answer for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>? Let us explicitly state what we did, and why it is allowed.
Consider the first equation again; we know we can add and subtract the same thing from both sides without affecting the equality.
The question then is, did we subtract the same thing from both sides?
| Since the second equation is, well an equation, then again by definitio both sides are equal. So, subtracting the LHS of the second equation from the LHS of the first equation while also subtracting the RHS of the second equation from the RHS of the first equation is performing the exact operation on both sides of the first equation. What we just did, and in general adding and subtracting equations of a system, still follows the basic logic of equality.</p>
<p>Now that we know <span class="math inline">\(y=4\)</span>, we can plug it back in any equation to solve for the remaining variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Let us pick the second equation, to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 2x + 2(4) = 14 \]</span></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we get that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x = 3 \]</span></p>
<p>Let us look at another system of equations:</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:Elimination2" class="example"><strong>Example 1.5  </strong></span><span class="math display">\[ 2x + 3y = 18 \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ x + 2y = 7 \]</span>
</div>
<p>It is not useful here to just add or subtract the equations, as that will not eliminate any variable. We need to first multiply one or more of the equations by a factor so that either of the variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> has the same coefficient in both equations. For example, we could multiply the first equation by <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(x + 3/2 y = 9\)</span>. Now, we have the same coefficient for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> which is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> so, we can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and then solve for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. However, we are now dealing with fractions, which is something we would like to avoid; not only because it would be easier to deal with by hand, but also it is better for numerical computations.
So, we could instead multiply the second equation by <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(2x + 4y = 14\)</span>. Now we have the same system of equations as before in example <a href="1-2-solving-systems-of-equations.html#exm:Elimination1">1.4</a>, so we can proceed the same way.</p>
<p>You may or may not have realized that this was <em>basically</em> the same system we just solved. This might provide you another chance for the realization that it is permitted to do the same operation on both sides of an equation.</p>
<p>Final note, if we cannot multiply one equation to get a coefficient equal to that of another equation, then we can multiply both equations by the coefficient of the other equation’s variable (the variable that we want to eliminate).</p>
